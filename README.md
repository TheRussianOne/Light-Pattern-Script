# Light-Pattern-Script
I thought of this idea when I was pulling someone over and had to change my vehicle extras to traffic advisor. Traffic advisor lights change the normal pattern from flashing to solid. The script is primarily made for police, but can be adapted for others.

# How it works
Using the command /ta true, extra 6 & extra 8 turn on and also turns extra 4 & extra 7 off.


**Note, currently this works when the configured to the vehicles I use, however, through the client.lua, you can change and adapt to your server**

# How to install
1. Drag file into folder
2. Drag folder in to server directory
3. Add folder name into server.cfg
